# angular-lesson-plan
Note: This lesson plan is for students who have learned React and have had a lesson on typescript. This is actually very similar to what I want to teach my students during regional content week.  This is meant to be a very gentle introduction to Angular.  Obviously this lesson plan will not be going over all concepts but this class could easily be expanded as needed.

In this class we will do a brief overview of Angular with a slide show.  The students will install Angular and make a small program.

## Slideshow and installing Angular (roughly 10 minutes)

* [`Angular SlideShow`](bitcoin-prices-unsolved.html)

Here are some questions your students might have during the slide show:
**What is a Framework?**
A framework provides structure to your code, more than just fixing a problem (libraries are more for fixing problems). Frameworks are more robust and larger.

**What is two-way data binding vs one-way?**
One-way data binding only allows the data to flow in one direction.  Two-way allows for back and forth. For example two-way data binding in Angular can have data move from the component to view and from view to the component. 

Have students install Angular while the slide show is displayed.  Also slack out this guide for them so they can copy and paste the commands:
